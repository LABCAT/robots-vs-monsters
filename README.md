### Robots vs Monsters

After my initial experiment using just the monster face I decided I wanted more variation in the results so have added the robot face as well.  

I have added tilt value to the both faces as I really like the effect that it has.  I also had to use the scale function to make sure the size of the robot faces aren't too big.  This is not variable at the moment but I may change this if my final submission consists a lot of faces. 

I haven't changed the range of the parameters for the robot face as they work very well.  For the monster I needed to reduce the range of the scale parameter as there is less space available compared to the previous part of the assignment.
