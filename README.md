### Robots

For my second parameterized face I have decided to create robot faces. Initially I didn't plan to use an existing character as inspiration for my designs.  However I did do an image search for "cartoon robots" to get the creative juices flowing. 

I did use parts of my code from the bender portraits I created in part one of the problem set. As a result, benders influence is definitely present in the design.  Initially I also used the eyes from Doraemon however I felt they didn't look robotic enough.

I think this face is quite effective in providing numerous different possibilities.
