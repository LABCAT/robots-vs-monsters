### Monster Face

For my final parameterized face I have decided to create monster faces.

For this face I wanted to do something interesting with the face shape. I have created a randomized pattern for the face shape and added a control that determines the level of zig zag present in the pattern.  This has produced very interesting results.

The colour of face pattern is determined mainly by a controllable hue. However I also added a splattering of random colours into the pattern to make it a little bit more interesting.  

Creating the mouth was interesting as it was the first time I had created custom shapes using vertex's which work very well.
