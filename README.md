### Cartoon Bears

For my first parameterized face I have decided to use cartoon bears.  I have used four cartoon bears as the basis for my design:

1. Kumamon: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumamon
2. Rilakkuma: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rilakkuma
3. Yogi Bear: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogi_Bear
4. Winnie the Pooh: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie-the-Pooh

My idea was the set up the controls in such a way that it would be possible to create a representation of each of the above bears. This has worked quite well for the first two bears as they are made from basic shapes.  However Yogi Bear and Winnie the Pooh aren't as simple so they are not as recognizable.  The idea still works very well though as there are many possible bear faces that can be created.
