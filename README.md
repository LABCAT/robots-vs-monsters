### Robots vs Monsters Distribution

For the distribution part of the project I have used both methods for controlling the distribution of traits for each face type.

I used a function for the discrete setting of each face. This is used to make it more likely that a robot will have three antennas and a monster will have one eye. 

I used the randomFocused function to control the pattern of a monster face and their eye size. It is also it used to control the face shape and height for the robot face as well as ensuring each robot has a unique colour.

The use of focus has made the population generated more likely to have the traits that I like the most.  Monsters with small faces are more likely to have bigger eyes and vice versa.  The robots are now very likely to each have a unique colour. They are also more likely have a square face or face with wings.
