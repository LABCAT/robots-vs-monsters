### Random Monsters

For my initial experiment of creating a random grid, I have used the monster face.  The first aspect of the design I noticed is that it didn't look right with all the faces on the same angle.  Because of this I added an extra parameter to control the tilt value which vastly improved the design.  My faces were also a bit big so I reduced the range of values available to set the scale. 

I think the ranges for the other parameters work quite well and don't need to be changed. I think that the hue parameter could possibly be improved by using a lookup table with a small set of hues rather than being completely random.
